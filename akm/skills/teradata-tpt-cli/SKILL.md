When working with the Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT) utility, you can use the command-line interface (CLI) to manage your data import and export tasks. The TPT CLI allows you to execute TPT scripts, monitor job status, and handle data transfers efficiently.

5 skills are available for the TPT CLI, read only the one useful for your task:
- @tpt-export.md: Use when exporting Teradata table data or query results to a CSV file
- @tpt-update.md: Use when updating existing records from a CSV file in an existing Teradata table using the MultiLoad operator
- @tpt-load.md: Use when loading data  from a CSV file into an empty Teradata table using the TDLoad operator for high-speed bulk loading
- @tpt-sql-inserter.md: Use when inserting data  from a CSV file into Teradata using the SQL Inserter operator
- @tpt-tdload.md: Use when quickly loading a CSV into a Teradata table or exporting a table to CSV without writing a full TPT script : 1 CSV to 1 table or 1 table to 1 CSV with no transformations, filtering, or complex logic.
